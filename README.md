# Awesome Search

Please check out the link below to see the new Awesome Search.  
http://dev.awesomelists.top

This is a react verison of [Awesome Search](https://github.com/lockys/AwesomeSearch) allowing users to search awesome lists in one seconds.  
The goal of this project is to practice React and to hope to build a better interface of Awesome Search.  
This project is still WIP... so bugs should exist.
